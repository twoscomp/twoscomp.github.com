title: Security Practice at PNC
---

<p>Due to a lack of standard password formats, I can&#8217;t seem to remember a lot of my passwords anymore. I got locked out of my PNC Bank online account recently and the debit card was destroyed a while back (don&#8217;t ask). So I needed to call PNC to unlock the account.</p>

<p>Over the phone they insisted on asking what the physical address of the branch that I opened my account at. Anyone who has gone to CMU can clearly tell you it&#8217;s the one in the UC basement (monopoly on banking in Pittsburgh). Apparently that branch does not show up on any of their records so they refuse to unlock. Instead they ask that I walk into a local branch to have it unlocked. Fair enough, I go to one near my apartment. Strangely enough, all they require to unlock an account at a local branch is your online ID and name; no photo ID, no social security number, anything else. You don&#8217;t even have to wait there while it&#8217;s being done. Someone will call you when you have access again.</p>

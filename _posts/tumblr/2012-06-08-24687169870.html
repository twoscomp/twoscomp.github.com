<p><span>The Apple vs. Motorola patent trial scheduled to start on Monday has now been dismissed with prejudice by Judge Richard Posner.</span></p>

<p><span>he says that neither Apple nor Motorola has proven exactly how much money any of the alleged patent infringements have cost, and that since both sides agree that money will fix everything, there&#8217;s no reason to block products either.</span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Basically, STFU and let the market decide. Good man.</p>

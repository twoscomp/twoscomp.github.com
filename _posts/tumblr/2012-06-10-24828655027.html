title: Game of Thrones averages 3.9 Million Pirated Copies/Episode
---

<p>The Oatmeal pretty much sums it up here: <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones" target="_blank"><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones" target="_blank">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones</a></a></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think HBO and other cable companies fully understand how to combat piracy. Piracy in its own nature is not THAT easy. There is the set up of software, knowing what sites to go to to find your stuff, and then of course the <strong>RISK of getting caught</strong>. The youtube generation growing up does not want a cable subscription. It wants videos on demand, when they want it and on any device they want it. You say it&#8217;s better on a large TV? Guess what, we&#8217;re not our parents, getting shit from our mobile devices to a TV is super easy today. I used to drag around RCA, S-Video cables, and a ground-loop isolator to do this. Now all you have to do is use AppleTV, Roku, SmartTV, All-Share, or <strong>HDMI</strong> cable to achieve this. Anyways the point is, when you don&#8217;t even provide me an option to pay for JUST online streaming HBO, my first inclination is not, &#8220;oh well I guess I&#8217;ll have to sign up for cable <em>AND</em> HBO,&#8221; it&#8217;s more like you&#8217;re forcing my hand. </p>

<p>Each episode of GoT is pirated around by 3.9 million users and only watched on HBO by <span>4.2 million users. HBO by choosing not pricing separate HBO Go streaming is missing out on a huge chunk of potential paying customers. <strong>Again piracy is not the problem, it is a symptom. Figure that out. </strong></span></p>

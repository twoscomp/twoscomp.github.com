title: 2 Weeks Notice
---

<p>Just copy, pasted, and sent off my resignation letter. I feel as though a huge weight has been unchained from my soul. The separation sequence has been initiated t-minus 2 weeks. As I write this my local manager (god bless her) is walking around the office letting my insanely inept supervisor known I&#8217;m quitting. This should be fun.</p>

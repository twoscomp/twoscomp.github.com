<p>I&#8217;ve recently been offered the chance to co-op at a game studio owned by Activision-Blizzard working on a unannounced project (I had to sign a NDA, but I would be completely ecstatic to work on this title). This would mean leaving my current full-time, well paying job for a temporary 6-8 month programming role with a hopes of becoming full-time. The games industry is notorious for instability, low pay, and long hours; but you know what? Chasing money is what got me into the position I&#8217;m in today; 9 to 5, well paid, stable, and negative job satisfaction. I feel like this a chance to go for the dream of working in games and see where it takes me. I think I&#8217;ve got my mind and heart set on this decision, now all I need is for a little divine intervention deflecting early termination penalties from Northrop Grumman to allow me to carry through with it.</p>

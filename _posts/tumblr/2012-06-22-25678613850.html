<p>Meet and follow Teamliquid&#8217;s players as they journey through the first 2 years of Starcraft II eSports. The documentary is free, but TL is taking contributions to help fund the project (they didn&#8217;t kickstarter it before filming). I&#8217;m happy to support this foundation of the SC community.</p>

title: Why care about Windows Phone 7?

<p>Because the iPhone SUCKS! no just kidding. The iPhone really is a great phone despite some of its flaws. Lets not forget that the Nexus one actually had reception issues when it first released too. It&#8217;s just that Apple products just tend to attract mainstream attention, and therefore defects get blown out all over your browsers.</p>

<p>But really, why should you wait for Windows Phone 7 this fall, and why is it going to be great? It basically comes down to Microsoft&#8217;s decision to exclusively use Qualcomm chipsets at release.</p>

<p>- &#8220;But you&#8217;re working at Qualcomm, of course you would say that!&#8221; </p>

<p>Trust me, it&#8217;s not because of Qualcomm that I predict WP7 release a great set of phones at launch. It could be Samsung, TI, Nvidia and I could care less. This is about the <strong>exclusivity</strong>. How come Apple can create such a fluid experience on the Iphone 4, all while it runs on a last generation 600Mhz A4 processor? How come the latest Google Android phones run cutting edge 1Ghz Snapdragons and can still stutter when scrolling home screens? The iphone has vertical integration, meaning Apple has complete control of product development all the way from top level software down to the nitty gritty hardware, tons of room to make specific hardware specific optimizations. Android on the other hand has to cater to a whole slew of companies&#8217; chips: Omap, Tegra, Hummingbird, Snapdragon etc. Not to mention the fragmentation of the Android market (screen sizes, dumb phones, oem skins).</p>

<p>Microsoft&#8217;s choice to lay down standards in hardware and support Qualcomm solely at the outset, I think, will prove to make a great product. I&#8217;ve had two chances now to look at the Samsung prototype that will ship with WP7 this fall, and I&#8217;ve got to tell you it&#8217;s super slick. If you&#8217;re in the market for a phone (*ahem* <strong>Julius</strong>) wait till October. And if you&#8217;re not happy with WP7, at least you&#8217;ll have passed some time for dual-core androids in December.</p>

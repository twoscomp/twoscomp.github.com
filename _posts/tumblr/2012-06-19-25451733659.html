<p>I&#8217;ve made a huge mistake. When it comes to certain things, I simply do not have any patience. One of these things is waiting for liquids to boil or cool. This weekend I may have killed a perfectly good vial of yeast. Some background first; I was going through the process of brewing my second brew, a basic chocolate stout. The idea is after the boil you try to rapidly cool the wort from boiling to ~70 degrees as fast as possible and then you pitch your yeast in. Without some special equipment or adequate ice, this takes a very long time with 5 gallons of boiling pre-beer. So what did I do? Instead of measuring it with a thermometer, I just pitched the yeast after the outside of my carboy felt warm instead of hot, not taking into account that the center of the container could have easily been 10-20F hotter. I probably tossed the yeast to their death. Dead yeast = no fermentation = no alcohol/bad alcohol. I&#8217;m still holding out hope that some of the little guys survived and are multiplying. This is Dan Lin, 48 hrs without fermentation. I will check again tonight, if there&#8217;s no action re-pitch and hope.</p>

<p>I came home to find it looking like this. This can mean one of two things, fermentation may be off to a slow start but it is starting OR it&#8217;s too late and bacteria has taken hold and it&#8217;s starting to infect. I popped the airlock and it didn&#8217;t smell south yet, so fingers crossed. If it does get gross, all is lost.</p>

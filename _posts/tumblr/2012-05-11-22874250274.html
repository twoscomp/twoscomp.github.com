<p>So I think there is a distinct sonic difference between when a group of American adults laugh and when a group of Asian adults laugh. Growing up, my parents always hosted pot lucks and bible studies at our house and I got used to listening to the way they burst into extremely tightly executed roars of laughter. I would characterize Asian laughs as very short, quick, and controlled roll up and roll down of laughing. I think American laughter is more free form and unique, where you can pick out each person&#8217;s characteristics and not everyone stops laughing at <strong>exactly</strong> the same time. After having been away from home after leaving for college so many years ago it wasn&#8217;t until the end of the day today that I heard a similar Asian sound signature coming from the conference room here at Samsung. lol weird.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been watching Star Trek: The Next Generation. One thing that I didn&#8217;t really grasp by watching sporadic reruns on UPN20 as a child, is that it&#8217;s really not really about space wars that fills the sci-fi genre. It&#8217;s an interesting concept. They live in a timeline where their computers can fabricate anything they want or need (i.e. infinite supply) so there isn&#8217;t that competitiveness that is drive by the need to accumulate material things (S01E25). So instead of the desire for wealth, there&#8217;s really nothing else to do but to explore and<strong> do scienceÂ </strong><strong>experiments</strong>. But then again I&#8217;ve only watched Season 1. When do the Borg come out?</p>

<p><strong>Forward</strong><br/>I wrote the majority of this November 2011. At the time I was very disgruntled at my work situation at Northrop Grumman so I decided to shelve to post. Well not much has changed and now that I&#8217;m leaving NGC, I present to you my post graduate nightmare. Enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>In the beginning</strong><br/>As many of y&#8217;all who have talked to me about my work situation may very well know, I have grown to despise this program and have an overwhelmingly negative opinion. That being said, I think it&#8217;s worth writing about my full experience in the program on the off chance that someone thinking about accepting into the program stumble upon my tumblr.</p>

<p>On the surface it may seem that I&#8217;ve only been with the company for a short six months. To some that may not seem like long enough to have made up my mind,Â  but to me it&#8217;s over a year that I&#8217;ve wasted with the FTL program.</p>

<p>Back in November 2010, I flew to San Diego for the final round interview process among all considered candidates for the program. It was an interesting experience which NGC clearly threw a lot of money behind. All levels of management and engineers from all over the company were flown out to pitch the program. The FTL program was advertised as a way to bring in top engineering and science graduate talent into NGC to help them work on and solve the &#8220;hard problems&#8221;, a buzz word repeatedly used to refer to what we would be doing. The is comprised of 3, one year rotations during which we would have a chance to see different parts of the company and &#8220;hone various technical skills&#8221;. Naturally this made a lot of sense to me since the defense industry has always been known to be at the front lines of developing next generation technology. Radar systems, Intelligence jamming devices, and active threat response systems, were shown of and demoed. There was constant talk about the need for young blood in the company to bring in an academia sense of problem solving. Part of the interview process was even to take a trip down to the labs at Rancho Carmel labs where they do radar and communications testing for the F-22 and new F-35 fighter jets. We were shown real life custom developed equipment and hardware. That was the last time many of us would ever step into a lab again.</p>

<p><strong>Sign here, here, and here</strong><br/>Shortly after, I signed with the program. I was slated to start at the end of June after I graduated in May. In the meantime, I was promised regular calls with my Division Representative (DREP) who would be my main contact and work with me to present my choices for my first rotation. They had six months, Dec-May, to find and figure out where I would fit best within NGC. In the next six months, I would have very sporadic contact with my DREP. Actually lets just call him DERPv1.0. At first the phone calls were somewhat productive. Exchanged some thoughts about what opportunities were available and what kind of things I was interested in. The phone calls gradually shortened in length and lessened in frequency. In the end, turns out it wasn&#8217;t until a week before I was due in Northern Virginia (NOVA) for orientation did I receive a call from a program located in VA, called Global Exchange (GEX) looking for a new FTL to backfill some 2nd year FTLs rotating out. I got the job description over the phone, seemed like a stupidly simple job. I made this point out to DERPv1.0, to which he responded that we really had no choice now but to move on. Oh <em>I&#8217;m</em> sorry, were you too busy dicking around at all your vaction homes to find me a rotation, so now <em>I </em>have <em>NO</em> choice and one week notice to start?</p>

<p>Note: It&#8217;s also very embarrassing how much money is wasted to relocate a single college student 264 miles with no real furniture. Some how it&#8217;s possible for the company to spend 16k after taxes to achieve this small feat.</p>

<p><strong>OH YEAH</strong><br/>FTL orientation goes something like this. &#8220;You&#8217;re the best and we have a lot of opportunities for you&#8221;. KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID KOOL AID. End orientation.</p>

<p><strong>Computers and Stuff</strong><br/>Without going into too much detail what my 1st rotation actually involves, it&#8217;s basically this. Ever heard of XML? No? Don&#8217;t worry go to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/xml/</a> It&#8217;ll probably take you all of 1 hr at most to learn everything there is possibly to know about XML. My job? Create test XML files and run them through a system to evaluate correctness. It is an incredibly tedious and monotonous job that really requires no skill or know how. I quickly devise a way to systemically work towards 100% testing coverage and script out my entire work flow. Mission accomplished. I quickly talk to my local manager with the hopes of being assigned some more technical oriented work. Some programming of <em>any</em> kind would be nice. You know, what I went to school for? She is very accommodating and sends my request up the chain to the GEX Program Manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t what he&#8217;s doing now technical? I mean it has to do with computers and files and stuff&#8221; - Program Manager</p>

<p><strong>Teleconferences and More</strong><br/>Eventually many of us figure out that the FTL program has no intention of churning out <em>technical</em> leaders. It&#8217;s simply a way to retain talent and produce more and more functional managers to replace those that are quickly reaching retirement age. Through all the leadership meetings I&#8217;ve sat through one thing is very apparent, NGIS&#8217; main focus is to make bids, win contracts, sub-contract the work out to other smaller defense groups, and then piece the parts back together. There&#8217;s is actually very little R&amp;D or development that occurs in house. We&#8217;re just the middle man that profits.</p>

<p>I know there are pockets of real projects here and there in NGIS, but they are ridiculously hidden away especially if you&#8217;re waiting on clearance (also completely mishandled by the FTL program). And even if you can find these interesting projects, there is the additional work of convincing them to find reason and budget to bring you in for only a year. That leaves most of us interested in actually being part of developing a real product to look toward Aerospace (NGAS) or Electronic Systems (NGES) for work, but getting the okay to do cross-sector work is incredibly hard and you get the sense that NGIS doesn&#8217;t want us to leave their sector.</p>

<p><strong>Darkest Before the Dawn</strong><br/>Around November 2010 I have absolutely nothing to do at work anymore. To fill my time I&#8217;ve been asked to write a step-by-step guide for new employees on how you can test anything. This is probably one of the most insanely stupid things anyone has ever asked me to do. Around this time I also receive a new DREP. DERPv1.0 is retiring.</p>

<p>I convey to him that my skills are languishing at my current position and I am in desperate need of a challenge. He tells me to hang in there and &#8220;we&#8217;ll see if we can&#8217;t turn it around for you in year two.&#8221;</p>

<p>A couple months pass like this until I am scheduled another call with my DREP to start discussing rotation two opportunities. After reiterating that I&#8217;m not getting the opportunity or challenges I need to grow as an engineer at my current rotation, I put forth that I am in desperate need of a <em>technically</em> challenging engineering development position in rotation 2. And then it happens&#8230; surprise, a wild DERPv2.0 appears; faster, stronger, less interested in my personal career direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really had a Business Development (BD) rotation in mind for you in round 2.&#8221; - DERPv2.0</p>

<p>A BD position is basically one in which you and your team gather information about possible technologies and solutions to put together a whitepaper or proposal to gain the company more business. I&#8217;m really not okay with a BD position in round two. To he responds &#8220;well maybe this program isn&#8217;t right for you&#8221;.</p>

<p>No it&#8217;s really okay FTL Program, I now have my sights on Silicon Valley. Until next time NGC&#8230; Nahhh, just just kidding, enjoy your never ending circle jerk. <br/><br/><strong>Update and Advice to the FTLP (1/26/2012)<br/></strong>I&#8217;ve secured a position in San Jose, CA and I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the prospects. I will be relocating in about a months time and will be starting at Samsung Mobile R&amp;D. The lab is small with only about 100 on site employees and drives to imagine new features for Samung&#8217;s line of cellphones and tablets. Everything about the new job is better from benefits all the way down to the cafeteria.<br/><br/>If the FTL program is wondering what they could do now to have kept me? Nothing. But there are things you could do to satisfy others still in the program. The way I see it they really have two options. The FTL program could redefine itself to find programs that satisfy the engineers and scientists they have chosen to recruit (not likely to happen), or change the way they recruit focusing more on people who have interests in IT and management. It&#8217;s really as simple as that. If you only have IT oriented rotations available in NGIS, don&#8217;t recruit people who are qualified but don&#8217;t have IT related backgrounds because chances are they&#8217;ll grow weary and leave. What is needed to be done is to evaluate the rotation opportunities you currently and recruit for those opportunities. Don&#8217;t oversell what your program is. For example, if you&#8217;re going to show off the labs at San Diego, please make it clear what percentage of us will actually land at anyone of these development centers. If it&#8217;s too low a number and is in fact embarrassing, then don&#8217;t take candidates to the labs in the first place. You&#8217;ll just get the wrong idea into their heads. In fact I would go as far as to say just take technical out of the name all together. Paint a realistic picture from the get go rather than after everyone&#8217;s situated, and I promise you both the program and those who choose to join it will be much better off.</p>

<p>I like to think of it this way. There is a reason the golden arches will turn away people who are over qualified to be a burger flipper. They will probably get the work done just fine. However, at the same time they&#8217;re likely to be unhappy with the work/environment and jump ship at the slightest hint of a better opportunity. And when you really think about it, that&#8217;s all that I was doing at my rotation, making xml burgers for customer testing.</p>

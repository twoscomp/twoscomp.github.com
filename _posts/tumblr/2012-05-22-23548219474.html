Maker Faire is just about the coolest thing you can imagine. If you&#8217;re not familiar with what it is, think of a science fair x art gallery from elementary school, except all artists and engineers are now adults and haven&#8217;t yet learned any limitations. Just a lot of fun. Check out my 2 min video summary.</p>

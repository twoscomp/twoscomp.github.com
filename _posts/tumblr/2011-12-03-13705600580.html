<blockquote><p>Asian students have higher average SAT scores than any other group, including whites. A study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade examined applicants to top colleges from 1997, when the maximum SAT score was 1600 (today it&#8217;s 2400). Espenshade found that Asian-Americans needed a 1550 SAT to have an equal chance of getting into an elite college as white students with a 1410 or black students with an 1100.</p>



<p>Top schools that don&#8217;t ask about race in admissions process have very high percentages of Asian students. The California Institute of Technology, a private school that chooses not to consider race, is about one-third Asian. (Thirteen percent of California residents have Asian heritage.) The University of California-Berkeley, which is forbidden by state law to consider race in admissions, is more than 40 percent Asian â€” up from about 20 percent before the law was passed.</p></blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/asians-college-strategy-dont-check-asian-174442977.html" target="_blank">don&#8217;t check asian</a>

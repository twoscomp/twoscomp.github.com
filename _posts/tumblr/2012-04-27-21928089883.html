<a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=332618">David Kim Calling Out Protoss Players</a><br/><p>Wow, in the latest balance update David Kim basically calls out protoss players are lacking in skill compared to terran and zerg players.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>&#8220;We are concerned that protoss players seem to be having a slower start compared to zerg or terran players. For quite some time after StarCraft II was released, especially at the highest levels of professional play, protoss players were primarily only focusing on 1 base or 2 base warp gate all-ins. It was only after we toned down these builds that protoss players really started exploring their various tech options in the same way that the other two races have been doing for a long time.&#8221;<br/></span></p>

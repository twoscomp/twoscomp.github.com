<p><em>&#8220;EVE Online&#8217;sÂ </em><span>largest economic hub is currently under attack by a massive alliance of the game&#8217;s most ruthless players, infamously known as &#8220;Goonswarm,&#8221;</span></p>

</blockquote>

<p><span>To me this is everything that an MMO should be, a realistic wild west of thievery and debauchery. The Goonswarm is currently launching a coordinated attack on one of the game&#8217;s &#8220;high security&#8221; areas that is intended to keep &#8220;less hardcore&#8221; players safe from in game raids, scams, and overall space piracy; typical of non-sec areas that the Goodswarm reside in. Usually the in game AI security can take out anyone attempting to launch such attacks, but Goonswarm has spent months preparing a fleet of 15000 suicide ships to overcome the security AI with an overwhelming show of force. The most brilliant part? EVE&#8217;s developers won&#8217;t swoop in with their almighty ban hammer and fix the situation because the type world in which something like this is possible is exactly what they intended.</span></p>

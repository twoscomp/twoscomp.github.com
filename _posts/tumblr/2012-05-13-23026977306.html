<p>Great news! Batman Live has announced dates for San Jose. Originally I was going to travel down to Anaheim if the bay area didn&#8217;t make their world tour list, but now I won&#8217;t have to. They&#8217;ll be in the bay area Sept 20-22nd. Think of it as as Batman x Cirque Du Solei. It looks awesome as they look to be playing more true to Batman TAS and Detective Comics styled Batman. I plan on purchasing tickets for one of these dates sometime this week, so let me know if you want in.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: On a side note this tongue in cheek Superman x Batman musical is pretty funny on youtube <iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hmZhMeY5L44" width="560"></iframe></p>

title: O God, It's Arrested Development All Over Again
---

<p><strong>Update: </strong>NBC has extended Community for another 13 episodes but has decided to let go Dan Harmon, the show&#8217;s creator. Doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8230;<br/><a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/joel_mchale_community_cast_share_their/317659" target="_blank"><a href="http://goo.gl/mdkwL" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/mdkwL</a></a></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a Community fan, you&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard the rumors that it has been axed by NBC mid-season. This feels all too familiar to the Arrested Development Fox fiasco of 2006 (still have yet to see the banana stand return). And while our hearts may break and surely the 20&#8217;s something online generation will protest; Wannabe sitcoms such as The Big Bang Theory that lack real creative depth will continue to live on with its pandering of faux geek culture. *dammit* This is why we can&#8217;t have <strike>nice things</strike> smart comedy.</p>

<p>The word is that community is merely on detention and <em>may</em> return at a later date, thanks NBC, you&#8217;ve officially made this the<strong> darkest of all timelines.</strong></p>

<p>Addendum: 30 Rock has been renewed for a shortened final season. Parks and Recreation is likely gone.<strong><br/></strong></p>

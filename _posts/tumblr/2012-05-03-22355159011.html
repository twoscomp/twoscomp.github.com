<p>Today was the launch of the Samsung Galaxy SIII. The intertubes is already full of mixed reactions. I think most of it is negative in regards to the design. It seems as if a lot of people wanted something that &#8220;pushed the envelope&#8221; while the SIII design seems more iterative than innovative. Packaging aside, the internals are really strong. So far it has been announced that the global version will have the new Exynos 4 Quad-core processor. Early benchmarks are showing that it absolutely crushes the Tegra 3 inside the new HTC One-X Hopefully the US will get the same as the global version and not some lame Qualcomm variant.</p>

<p>The two new software features that I&#8217;m most excited about would have to be Eye-tracking and All-Share. Eye-tracking will keep the phone screen on as long as you are looking at it, hence &#8220;it knows&#8217;s when you&#8217;re watching&#8221; and &#8220;knows when you&#8217;re asleep&#8221; (super creepy catch-phrases for <strike>a phone,</strike> anything). Who know&#8217;s how useful that&#8217;ll <strong>actually</strong>Â be (probably not), but I hope that the Eye-tracking SDK is made public. That could make for some very interesting apps.</p>

<p>Being on an iPhone after my Nexus S had an incident with the washing machine has made me really miss Android&#8217;s core applications and more importantly application intents. In any case I have an extra phone number lying around so I might pick one at the US release in June.</p>

<p>The venue today was super nice but Samsung&#8217;s speaking presentation still needs a lot of work; I think this is probably embedded in an Asian culture difference that will be very hard to break. One thing is for sure though, thank God they didn&#8217;t bring back Zoll (CES 2011), the child of the future.</p>

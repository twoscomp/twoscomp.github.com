<p>One thing missed in this article is that training for the spelling bee teaches kids to value/be proud of book smarts. There is a reason America churns out more athletic genius than any other country. From a very young age we send our kids to little leagues and after school sports clubs. If they show promise we continue to encourage them with spots on high school varsity teams which lead to college scholarships to play sports in the hopes of making the big bucks in the big leagues. All these special rewards and avenues for the physically talented, and what about those who show mental excellence. Sure there are also merit based academic scholarships, it&#8217;s not nearly as generous and glamorous as it should be. As a kid showing you care about your education often leads to ostracism. Why is it uncool to care?</p>



<p>TL;DR Physical aspirations are overly sold to our youth. Balance should be found.</p>

<p>On and off I&#8217;ve been toying with idea of leaving the halls of Facebook for some time now, and today I&#8217;ve decided to pull the plug (at least temporarily). The idea is that by walking away from the consumption of news feed updates, notifications, and the barrage of information that comes from being constantly connected to some 640 people at a click of a button; I&#8217;ll be able to simplify my life and focus my train of thought on self-improvement and producing something important to me. Who knows how long it&#8217;ll last, but I think it&#8217;s worth a try.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that Facebook is the easiest way for me to keep up to date of some extended family, but there should be other avenues for doing that and probably all for the better. Farewell Facebook friends, although I am stepping away, I will still be updating (albeit with less frequency) this website, my twitter, and twitch.tv stream. </p>

<p>PS. I do however think it&#8217;s awesome that Frank Wu is represented by a plate of diner food.</p>

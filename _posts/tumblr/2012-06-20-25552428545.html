title: Military's Failed 15-year Quest for a Software Defined Radio
---

<p>They basically let unrealistic expectations and feature creep kill their project. Too bad no one in defense knows how to fail fast, only fail big. Not surprising. How good can a rdio be when it fails to work due to heat in New Mexico? In case they haven&#8217;t noticed, we haven&#8217;t really been fighting wars in cold environments.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span>JTRS provides a textbook case of what </span><em>not</em><span> to do in a technology development program, proving that even a few great ideas can’t save a project that has been over-specified and under-tested, and that remains blinkered to what&#8217;s going on in the world around it.</span></p>

<p>While JTRS’s SDR approach focused on making one radio that could do everything with FPGAs, it was actually a bet against Moore’s Law—that it would be cheaper and easier to have one radio you could add new waveforms to than simply buying another radio. But it turns out, as the consumer wireless market has proven, that it may be cheaper to make lots of single-purpose radios that plug together and get tossed when there’s an upgrade.</p>

<p><span>To be specific, the problem is rooted in the way project leaders defined “better” over a decade and a half. They seemed to mistake it for a synonym of “more.” How exactly did the Army go about making the radio better and better? By increasing its complexity, extending the schedule, spending more money and making the device larger. Engineers continuously added features and functions and capabilities on paper, all of which made the design worse and made the users wait. Vaporware much?</span></p>

<p>When JTRS began, there was no WiFi, no 3G or no 4G wireless, and commercial radio communications was relatively expensive. But the consumer industry didn&#8217;t even look at SDR as a way to keep its products relevant in the future. No, ASIC-based digital signal processors are cheap, and new products also tend to include faster chips and new hardware features; people prefer buying a new $100 WiFi router when some future 802.11z protocol appears instead of buying a $3,000 wireless router today that is “future proofed” (and you can&#8217;t really call anything based on CORBA “future proofed”).</p>

<p>Paul Miller of theverge.com has decided to embark on a 1 year journey without the internet (despite the fact that he is a journalist working at a technology blog) in the hopes that it will help him find new perspective and help filter out all the information noise that bombards us everyday. He has some dead serious rules too. When was the last time you paid your bills through snail mail or over the phone? </p>

<p>I took a similar journey once back in 2009 at CMU, although only for a few months and much less restricted. I went on a computer fast where I only allowed myself to use a computer either in the lab or at the library. This has two immediate effects. 1). You spend  a lot more time in the lab and the library. 2). You spend your free time the way you imagine it, rather than procrastinating by pursuing mindless activities eg. facebook, netflix, youtube (I didn&#8217;t read reddit back then). Imagine that, procrastinating free time. But it&#8217;s true, I think there are a lot of things people, myself included, <em>want</em> to do with their free time but end up squandering a lot of it checking updates or looking/watching stupid internet memes. And then we complain that &#8220;O man I just don&#8217;t have enough hours in a day to accomplish the things I <em>want</em> to do. A stupid example, there are days when I want to commit myself to play more ladder games for Starcraft II. I think all day to myself that I&#8217;m going to get home from work and hammer out 10 ladder games before sleep, but unsurprisingly I waste a big chunk of that time choosing the easier path of surfing the internet. I suspect it has a lot to do with the fact that it&#8217;s a lot easier to consume than produce something. More recently I went on a Facebook fast to help refocus my efforts at some personal projects and finding a new job. At first it feels hopelessly impossible to live without seeing all the most interesting links or friend updates, but progressively that anxiety settles and all you&#8217;re left with noiseless time and environment to focus. The end game isn&#8217;t to quit the internet or computers, but rather it is to prove to yourself that it can be done and find the will power to do it.</p>

<p>So I salute you Paul Miller, I look forward to reading your opinions on technology formulated in an internet vacuum and by old school research methods. Let me know how that pixel density on that dumb phone is. Also while you&#8217;re off the internet, get a haircut you damn hippie.</p>

<p>Addendum: I would like to point out that these days Facebook feeds are flooded with more shit from 9gag (dumpster of the internet) than actual interesting updates on friends lives.</p>

<p>The Avengers is a movie with a thin and disposable plot that still manages to be wildly entertaining through spectacular visuals and humor (in a large part thanks to RDJ). <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/" target="_blank">Joss Whedon</a>, of Buffy the Vampire fame, knows how to both write and direct a hell of a screen play. $20 IMAX worthy.</p>

<p>The following will be a spoiler for anyone who really loves comics and the marvel universe. If you don&#8217;t, it probably won&#8217;t mean anything to you.</p>

<p>Thanos, who is basically Marvel&#8217;s version of DC&#8217;sÂ <span>Darkseid (Darkseid in my opinion much cooler with his Omega Beam aka eye lazers. PEW PEW!), show&#8217;s up in the middle of the credits.</span></p>

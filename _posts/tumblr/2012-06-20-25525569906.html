<p>He&#8217;s so entertaining, DRAAAMMAAA</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Posner: &#8221;But you have to explain to me why it&#8217;s a rational choice. [Laughing.] &#8220;What&#8217;s to prevent you after three months from suing them again and saying it&#8217;s still infringing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Apple: We can file a new suit. [Paraphrasing.]</p>

<p>Posner: &#8221;Great, that&#8217;s all we need, new suits. There aren&#8217;t enough lawsuits worldwide between Apple and all the Android manufacturers.&#8221;</p>

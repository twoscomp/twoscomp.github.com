title: Adventures in Homebrew

<p>Today I decided to give a shot a brewing my first  beer. Earlier this week I stopped by a local homebrew shop to pick up all the supplies and basic tools necessary to make my very first 5 gallon batch of light ale.</p>

<p>The process first starts by getting proper inspiration</p>

<p>Okay real first step is to sanitize anything that will come in contact with the wort (beer before it is fermented). This involves washing and soaking all tools in an acid wash until used. The wort itself makes an ideal environment for bacteria growth, hence all the necessary precautions.</p>

<p>For my first time, I&#8217;m only doing a partial boil. That&#8217;s where you only boil about 3 gallons of the grain, malt extract, and hops. The other 2 gallons comes from the water that is added after the boil to rapidly cool the wort. The wort has almost all the characteristics of beer except it&#8217;s loaded with sugar and is super sweet. </p>

<p>Once boiled and chilled back to room temp, ale yeast is added. The wort is then transferred to the carboy for fermentation. Over the next week the yeast will consume all the sugars in the wort releasing the alcohol that makes the wort beer. Before we seal it off with our blow off valve, I take a quick sample to measure the original gravity. Sugars make the solution denser. As the yeast consumes the sugar  during fermentation we expect to see the gravity drop. Taking the difference between the original and final gravity should give us a pretty good indication of when the fermentation process has ceased. We can also use it to calculate potential alcohol content. </p>

<p>The carboy is then sealed and moved into my closet. Come back in a week for bottling.</p>

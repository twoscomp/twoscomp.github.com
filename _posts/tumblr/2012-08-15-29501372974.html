title: Self Serving Ohio Republicans Officials
---

<p>Republican officials plan on allowing early voting in Republican controlled districts and attempting to deny early/weekend voting in, surprise surprise, Democratically controlled Cincinnati. That seems fair. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<span>If you live in Butler or Warren counties in the Republican-leaning suburbs of Cincinnati, you can vote for president beginning in October by going to a polling place in the evening or on weekends&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span>But, if you live in Cincinnati, you’re out of luck. Republicans on the county election board are planning to end early voting in the city promptly at 5 p.m., and ban it completely on weekends&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>In March 2011, more than two years after Citigroup took $45 billion in bailouts from the U.S. government and </span><a href="http://bloom.bg/r5LMSs" rel="external" title="Open Web Site" target="_blank">billions more</a><span> from the </span><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/federal-reserve/" target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a><span> &#8212; more in total than any other </span><a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/u.s.-bank/" target="_blank">U.S. bank</a><span> &#8212; Jeffery Polkinghorne, an O’Fallon executive in charge of loan quality, asked Hunt and a colleague to stay in a conference room after a meeting.</span></p>

<p>In August 2011, five months after the meeting with Polkinghorne, Hunt sued Citigroup in Manhattan federal court, accusing its home-loan division of systematically violating U.S. mortgage regulations.</p>

<p>The U.S. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/justice-department/" target="_blank">Justice Department</a> decided to join her suit in January. Citigroup didn’t dispute any of Hunt’s facts; it didn’t mount a defense in public or in court. On Feb. 15, 2012, the bank agreed to pay $158.3 million to the U.S. government to settle the case.</p>

<p>We bail them out for $45b when they fucked us with their dishonest dealings, and now we win back $158.3m? I&#8217;m happy that the lady wins for standing up for business ethics, but the numbers here make me sad.</p>

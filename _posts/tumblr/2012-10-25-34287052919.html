<p>Watching this weeks South Park episode, A Nightmare on Face Time, reminded me how much I enjoyed browsing Blockbuster with my family growing up. The Internet is super convenient, but there is something extremely satisfying about looking at the back of VHS boxes and walking home with a movie and video game for $5 once a week.</p>



<p>Never those new release 2-day rentals though. </p>

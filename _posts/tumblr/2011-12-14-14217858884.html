title: the importance of breakfast
---

<p>Today, I woke up a little later than usual. No big deal, but that means skipping breakfast. I  get to work and our crapateria is closed. No surprise, I want pop tarts  from the vending machine anyways. We have two vending machines of the  same model. So I go to machine A, dollar in hand. No luck, it wants  exact change. I press the change button, and it spits out a dollar coin. Walk over toÂ  machine B that is flashing &#8220;coins only.&#8221;  No problem, I have a shiny mint condition dollar coin now! Put in the dollar coin and it gets  stuck in the coin slot. I push it with a credit card, try to chopstick it with two credit cards, but it won&#8217;t go in  and won&#8217;t come out. Why would two machines of the same model not  accept the same coins, or even worse spit out a stupid coin neither one accepts!  At this point I realize I&#8217;m not getting breakfast.</p>

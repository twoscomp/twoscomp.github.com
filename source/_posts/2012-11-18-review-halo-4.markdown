More than a decade after Halo: Combat Evolved, the Halo franchise returns to us under the direction of 343 Industries. Halo 4 is the 4th game starring Master Chief, 6th game in the series, the start of a new trilogy, and probably the last Halo to debut on the Xbox 360. Is it any good? 

Story
-----
I'm going to call this part of my review spoiler free simply because I don't really think there is much to spoil here for you, but if you want to be really cautious do skip ahead. 

Even though I had played all of the previous Halos I had a hard time remembering the story line. Halo Reach, the last game in the franchise, was a prequel to the series so naturally I had to hit up [Wikipedia]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(series)") to catch up.

When we last left Master Chief and Cortana, they were aboard half of the UNSC frigate *Forward Unto Dawn* which was cut off during a slip-space jump. Master Chief has entered hibernation leaving Cortana with the command "wake me when you need me"; with the rest of humanity assuming him dead. Halo 4 picks up with the *Forward Unto Dawn* drifting into the space around a Forerunner planet deemed Requiem. At this point Cortana wakes Master Chief and the fight begins. I'm not going to cover the entire story here.

My overall impression of the story is: not very long, but kind of confusing. The campaign can be played through on regular difficulty in just about 4-6 hours which I consider to be relatively short. This is not entirely a knock against the game, because as with all Halo games it's pretty challenging and rewarding to play through multiple times at harder difficulty and modifiers. The plot is your generally formulaic space alien wants to destroy humanity, humanity tries to defend itself, humanity calls upon lone soldier hero to stop crazy space alien. Here the main villain is the Didact who appears to be some sort of extremist military leader of the ancient alien race, the Forerunners. The Didact feels that the human race was the reason for the Forerunner's fall and therefore feels it necessary to wipe them out. His method doing this is the *Composer* which as far as I can tell, digitizes bio life? That's really as far as the game goes into explaining what it is. Basically it's bad and Master Chief needs to stop the Didact from using it.

That's about it. A player isn't offered much more detailed background throughout than the basic premise. I feel that this lack of details both contributes and retracts from my overall story score. While playing through campaign, I was constantly thinking "What is going on? Who is this Didact? Where are we? What is the composer? What am I stopping him from doing?" NONE of these questions are adequately through gameplay. Instead 343 has opted to leave hidden terminals throughout the game which unlock background video content in Halo Waypoint. Why do this? Why no just show me in game? Maybe the CG cutscenes were too much to put up for or maybe they were added as afterthoughts when they played through the game themselves and though, geez no one is going to have any clue what is going on. The upside though, is that these questions leave me wanting to find out more and have opened the doors to a whole new universe that 343 will hopefully expand upon throughout this new trilogy. I think they've put themselves in a good spot. 
Gameplay
--------
####General
Halo 4 fundamentally feels like part of the franchise, but is slightly different in an updated refreshing sort of way. Because it's been quite sometime since I've played Halo 1-3, my comparisons will be to Halo Reach. The controls feel a slightly lighter and quicker in reaction. I definitely felt that in previous games the Spartan warrior felt a little clunky and slow. It's not enough to change your total idea of how the *Mjolnir* armor moves, but just enough for you to notice and appreciate. Kind of like and upgrade.

That's how the gameplay feels overall, it's the same Halo you've come to know, but slightly different, maybe a bit better. 

####Armor Abilities
Reach placed a heavy emphasis on special armor abilities. Halo 4 has kept the armor abilities but taken their importance down a notch. This is a welcome change in multiplayer which means that more focus is placed a player's choice of weapon and aim. I've encountered one or two situations where another player's use of the *hardened light shield* to block my potentially deadly melee bash prompted awe and spectacle from me. That's what armor abilities should be like, not a main tool for competition but something that, if used and timed correctly, can produce jaw dropping results.  

####Weapons
Halo 4 introduces a new line of Promethean weapons. The new weapons are futuristic pistols, rifles, and canons that shoot *hardened light*, whatever that is. If you haven't played the game, just imagine futuristic human pistols, rifles and canons in look, but they shoot lasers, so guess I should have just said laser guns.

The introduction of more guns does give the player more choice in which weapon to use in disposing the enemy, but generally each weapon has it's sibling in one of the other 2 weapon categories (Human, Covenant, and Promethean). The variety is nice, but isn't downright game changing. That being said, the Promethean weapons do have very cool reload animations which consist of the gun blowing up (imagine blow up diagrams of engines), ammo being inserted, and then the gun reassembling itself. Futuristic indeed.

####Campaign
The campaign gameplay is much like the story, very formulaic. Most of the missions in the chapters consist of different rifts of:

```
You're at point A.
Get to Objective B.
Destroy/Activate Objective C.
Kill all the enemies in between.
```

And that's pretty much okay, because again the campaign is only 4-6 hours long. If it were twice that, it would get pretty tedious and boring. Along with a new line of weapons, Halo 4 also introduces a new line of baddies, the Prometheans. The Promethean enemies consist of 3 categories; Crawlers, Sentries, and Knights. Each class has it's own tier system with tougher enemies at the top. The Crawlers are basically this robotic feral dog looking things which serve as the foot solider of the Promethean enemies. They serve as annoying distractions that can sneak up and overwhelm you if not keeping careful watch. The main threat is the Promethean Knights which carry hard hitting weapons along with teleportation powers which they use both for retreating and ambushing. Sentries are a support class which serve to shield or even resurrect the other two categories. 343 has done a rather good job of making the Prometheans a menacing enemy. I found myself dreading sequences where I would have to fight Prometheans and hoping to rather fight a wave from the Covenant army. It's akin to the first time you face Covenant Elites with energy swords.

Campaign gameplay keeps to a simply formula, but remains challenging enough on Normal difficulty setting to keep a player alert and awake. It's also packaged short enough, to make you want to play it again either in co-op or harder settings. 

####War Games
War Games is the multiplayer portion of Halo 4. The idea is that you are all bunch of UNSC Spartans taking part in combat excercises, hence the *War Games* moniker.

In the short amount of time I've spent in War Games, it's fun and primed for e-sports. Halo 4's release having been flanked by *Call of Duty: Black Ops 2* will suffer a bit in player count, but I think the tweaks that 343 has made to both the game and online game modes will make it a great title at the highest levels of competitive gameplay. 

Halo has learned a few lessons from popular multiplayer shooters as of late. Gaining experience through playing now not only unlocks superfluous armor customizations, but also yields points which can be spent on customizing a player's loadouts. Which includes starting guns, armor abilities, and various power modifiers. I haven't come down on a decision whether I like this, but as long as the game's matchmaking system does a good job of putting you in games where you won't be entirely outmatched by loadouts, I think you'll be okay. Again I think 343 has made an effort to make player mechanics outweigh special abilities or gun types. Play better, and you'll score better regardless of other player loadouts.

My favorite War Game playlist thus far has to be *SWAT*. This is a team based deathmatch with no radar, no armor abilities, no ordinance, and one shot headshots. It's strategy and reflexes at it's purest. No radar means being much more aware of your surroundings and making sure you check all sectors in an area or become a tick on the opposing team's scoreboard. One shot headshots allows for concentrated firefights where triple and overkills are not uncommon.  

####Spartan Ops
At this time I have only put an hour or so into Spartan Ops. From what I know, this is basically a PvE style multiplayer game where players fight through waves of enemies in increasing difficulty to reach or defend an objective. The interesting twist here is that these will be released in an episodic manner wrapped in a story told through CG cutscenes provided with each episode. Great additional game content, not necessarily my thing.

Presentation
------------
This is probably the last Halo that will see release on the Xbox 360 as it nears it's 10 year cycle. Halo 4 is not the most impressive looking game out there right now, especially when you compare it some recent releases on PC. Now my memory may be failing me but, I think it's only marginally better looking in the graphics department when compared to Reach. Overall I think you can tell that polygon count is up, which results in more complex shapes, but I feel that 343 may have had to adjust for the aging platform by dialing back texture qualities. There are many instances where the surrounding scenery just seems rather flat and washed out not to mention the game is filled with jaggies. Again, aging platform just might not have enough power to smooth out all those lines.

Halo 4 does a very good job though, of making you feel like you are Master Chief. The on screen HUD has been redone to look like all the information is being fed through the visor of Master Chief's helmet. This is done very well and remains mostly unobtrusive throughout. The one point of contention I'll have to take with this, is the over use of bloom sometimes. It really just made me feel like the visor was all fogged up and need a good wiping down. 

If we're going to talk about immersion though, the sound department really hit it home. While the soundtrack wasn't as epic and memorable as previous games, it does provide a great deal of ambiance to the unknown Forerunner world. Gun sounds, are what really did it for me. It's that 343 heavily tweaked or recorded new sounds for all the guns. The DMR, Assault Rifle, and Magnum really have this satisfying full range rattle and snap acoustic quality that bring the tuns alive. It goes a long way to making you feel like you're actually there gunning through enemies to stop the Didact.

Bottom Line
-----------

Halo 4 is about both endings and new beginnings. It's an end to an era of Bungie produced Halo games and the last Halo to see life on the Xbox 360; at the same time it's our introduction to a new trilogy with 343 Industries at the helm, who I think have done a very respectful job taking care of a universe many care about. I think Halo 4 is a great game and must have for any fan of the series. For newcomers, I would perhaps recommend picking up previous games on the cheap if not to catch up, at least just to make sure you like the style of gameplay. I did and would again pay the release price of $60 for this game. The main reason being that it packs a tremendous amount of content in both gameplay and supplemental video lore (There is actually a lot to explore in Halo Waypoint) The campaign, although short, should provide you with enough incentive to play through at least twice, either at a harder level or with a friend. With MLG gearing for it's 2013 season, we should see some pretty exciting online play in the near future.

Score: 8.0
Buying Point: $50-60
